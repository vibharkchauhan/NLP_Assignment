On XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased three high school textbooks for my XXXX year old daughter because she transferred to a new school. All three books were damaged when a water bottle in her backpack broke. The Chase representative assured me the textbooks would be covered and instructed me to file a claim at XXXX. I immediately went to the website and filed the claim, including uploading all of the requested paperwork which included a copy of my credit card statement, copies of the three receipts and photographic evidence of the damage. The website even had \" books '' as one of the catagories I could list as the type of item they cover and that I could make a claim on.

       "78311  I have had flawless credit for 30 yrs. I've had Chase credit cards, \" Chase Freedom '' specifically since XXXX with no problems ever. I've done many balance transfers in my life, so I have plenty of experience. I recently did a balance transfer with Chase Freedom for {$9000.00} ( did many with other Chase cards, but apparently not \" Freeedom '' ) When I got my first bill, my minimum payment was {$470.00}. I was SHOCKED. I immediately called on XX/XX/XXXX. The representative told me that the min payment was so high bc they were making me pay the \" Balance transfer fee '' up front, but my future payments would be around {$90.00}, 1 % of total balance ( which is standard, AND the rate THEY ADVERTISE ) I went to pay the next payment on XX/XX/XXXX & was once again SHOCKED to see my minimum payment was {$440.00}. I paid it, but I have been trying to work this out with Chase ever since. Apparently, the representative was WRONG & I am actually expected to pay 5 %, instead of the standard 1...  \n",

I did that to close out my account roughly {$500.00} payment when I closed out the accounts, and now I get this late payment that showed up on my credit report after 10+ years stating I owe close to {$900.00} dollars. I have never had any payment schedules or notifications in the 10+ years because I paid it off. Upon calling them I am told I need to show proof I paid it off. I would like to think that if indeed I had not paid it off ( which I did ) I would have immediately received late payment notifications. I left Chase bank because of some poor customer service and charges that were way out of line with the other banking institutions.  \n",
